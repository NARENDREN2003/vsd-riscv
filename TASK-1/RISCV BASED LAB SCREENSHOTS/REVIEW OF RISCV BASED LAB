-mabi=lp64   : This instruction tells that the ABI (Application Binary Interface) to use lp64, which is for 64-bit integer, long and pointer size. 
               This ABI is used for 64-bit RISCV architecture.
-march=rv64i : This intruction tells that the architecture that we use, which is rv64i, indicates the 64-bit RISCV base integer instruction set. 
               This also confirms the targeting of 64-bit architecture.
riscv-objdump: It is a tool for disassembling RISC-V binaries, providing insights into the code structure and helping in debugging.
               riscv-objdump is a tool used to disassemble and inspect RISC-V binary files. 
               It is part of the GNU Binutils package and is useful for debugging and analyzing RISC-V executables, object files, and libraries.
-Ofast       : The option -Ofast in the command riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c is a compiler optimization flag used with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). This flag is used to instruct the compiler to optimize the generated code for maximum speed. The use of -Ofast is typically chosen for applications where execution speed is critical and where deviations from standard behavior are acceptable. However, it's important to test thoroughly, as this level of optimization can introduce subtle bugs, especially in complex calculations or when strict compliance with external standards is required.
-O1          : This options is an optimization level that tells the compiler to optimize the generated code but without greatly increasing compilation time. -O1 aims to reduce code size and execution time while keeping the compilation process relatively quick.
